# About This Project – SCCI Quiz Task

This project is a simple interactive quiz built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The goal is to create a basic training task to practice core JavaScript concepts such as:

- DOM Manipulation  
- Handling events  
- Validating user input  
- Displaying correct/incorrect feedback  

---

## Purpose of the Task

The quiz was designed around real questions related to **SCCI** to make the task more engaging and relevant for new participants.  
Each question has:

- A text input field  
- A button to check the answer  
- Immediate feedback (“Correct” or “Wrong”)  

This helps practice logic building and dynamic UI updates using pure JavaScript.
